## ðŸ›  Backend Installation & Setup  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
Clone the repository to your local machine:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/username/manga-reader-app.git(https://github.com/AlexanderK88/c11_examensarbete.git)  
```  

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory**  
```bash  
cd manga-reader-app  
```  

### **Step 3: Set Up the MySQL Database with Docker**  
1. **Ensure Docker is installed and running** on your system.  
   - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if itâ€™s not installed.  

2. **Add the dump file**: Ensure the `mydatabase_dump.sql` file is located in the root of the project directory (next to `docker-compose.yml`).  

3. **Start the Docker container**:  
   Run the following command to set up the MySQL database:  
   ```bash  
   docker-compose up -d  
   ```  

   This will:
   - Start a MySQL container.
   - Create the database `mydatabase`.
   - Import the tables and data from the `mydatabase_dump.sql` file.  

4. **Verify the database setup**:  
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to the **Database** tab.  
   - Add a new data source by choosing **MySQL**.  
   - Use the following credentials to connect:  
     - **Host:** `localhost`  
     - **Port:** `3306`  
     - **Username:** `root`  
     - **Password:** `verysecret`  
     - **Database:** `mydatabase`  

   Once connected, you should see the tables and data in the database.
